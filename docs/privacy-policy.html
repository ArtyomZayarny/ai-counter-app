        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

        <p>Ytilities ("we", "our", "the app") is a utility meter reading application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Account Data.</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address, display name, and a securely hashed password. If you sign in with Google, we receive your name, email address, and profile photo URL from Google. If you sign in with Apple, we receive your name and email address (or a private relay email if you choose to hide your email).</p>

        <p><strong>Camera &amp; Photos.</strong> The app uses your device camera to photograph utility meters. Photos are sent to our server for digit recognition and are not stored permanently — they are processed in real time and discarded after the reading is extracted.</p>

        <p><strong>Meter Readings.</strong> Recognized meter values (digits), meter type (gas, electricity, or water), and timestamps are stored in your account so you can track usage history.</p>

        <p><strong>Tariffs &amp; Bills.</strong> If you use the cost calculator, your tariff rates and calculated bills are stored in your account.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide the core service: recognizing meter digits from photos</li>
            <li>To maintain your reading history and calculate utility costs</li>
            <li>To authenticate your account and keep it secure</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p><strong>OpenAI API.</strong> Meter photos are sent to the OpenAI API (GPT-4o Vision) for digit recognition. Photos are processed according to <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a>. OpenAI does not use API inputs to train their models.</p>

        <p><strong>Google Sign-In.</strong> If you choose to sign in with Google, authentication is handled by Google's OAuth 2.0 service. We only receive your basic profile information (name, email, profile photo). See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign in with Apple.</strong> If you choose to sign in with Apple, authentication is handled by Apple's identity service. We receive your name and email address (or a private relay address if you choose to hide your email). See <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored on secure servers. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt and are never stored in plain text. All communication between the app and our servers uses HTTPS encryption. Authentication tokens are stored securely on your device using platform-native secure storage.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your account data and meter readings are retained as long as your account is active. You can delete your account directly in the app (menu → Delete Account), and all associated data will be permanently removed.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Access the personal data we hold about you</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your account and data</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent for data processing at any time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Ytilities is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
